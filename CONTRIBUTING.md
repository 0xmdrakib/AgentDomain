# Contributing to AgentDomain

Thank you for improving AgentDomain's public developer experience.

## Repository validation prerequisites

Repository contributors need **Python 3.11 or newer**, available as the `python`
command. The pre-install public-boundary check uses the standard-library `ast`
and `tomllib` modules; `pnpm ci:public` runs that check too. CI pins Python 3.12.
Confirm `python --version` before running repository installation or validation.

This is a repository QA prerequisite, not a Python runtime dependency for
consumers of the npm packages. The standalone Python integrations have their
own documented Python version and dependency requirements.

## Pull requests

Keep each pull request focused and explain the public behavior it changes. Add
or update tests and documentation when a public contract changes.

Before opening a pull request:

1. Run the public-boundary check and relevant tests.
2. Confirm no credentials, private keys, customer data, populated environment
   files, or generated artifacts are included.
3. Confirm new dependencies are necessary, license-compatible, and represented
   in the lockfile.
4. Confirm browser-visible settings contain public values only.
5. Confirm documentation links and examples work as written.

Never put a secret in browser-delivered configuration or client-side code. Keep
environment files untracked and committed examples value-free.

## Public release completion

Every authorized package version release includes the public tag and GitHub
release. These are release deliverables, not optional follow-up work.

1. Validate the reviewed public source with `pnpm ci:public`, secret scanning,
   package checks and the successful release workflow for the exact source SHA.
   For a coordinated release, check each publishable package version rather than
   the private workspace manifest's version.
2. Choose the release anchor before tagging. Require GitHub's
   `verification.verified: true` on the signed tag or its target commit. Preserve
   meaningful feature history with a signing-capable release or merge process.
   GitHub's Rebase and Merge creates replacement commits without signature
   verification; do not assume that a green merge result means a signed anchor.
3. Publish through the approved registry workflow and independently verify each
   package's version, archive checksum and available provenance. Record actual
   publication source SHAs and workflow runs, including any separately approved
   bootstrap exception. Do not imply that a later release tag was the publication
   source when it was not; verify package-tree equivalence where needed.
4. Create the matching public `npm-v<version>` tag for the coordinated release
   and a non-draft GitHub release with changelog, package/install links, source
   and verification evidence, and known limitations. Mark only the newest stable
   release Latest; identify prereleases as prereleases.
5. Read back the remote tag target and its GitHub signature status, the published
   release and Latest designation, and the actual npm/PyPI versions. A missing
   signature, tag, release or package remains an explicit incomplete step.

GitHub's **Verified** badge authenticates a Git signature. It is separate from
tests, a security review and registry artifact provenance. See GitHub's
[commit signature verification documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).

Do not silently move/delete published tags, rewrite public history, backdate
commits or republish immutable package versions to repair a missing badge. A
published-tag/history change or new account/security grant needs explicit owner
approval. Never commit signing keys or tokens, or bypass a verification gate when
the required signer is unavailable; report the exact unfinished prerequisite.

## Security reports

Do not disclose vulnerabilities in an issue or pull request. Follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for confidential reporting.
