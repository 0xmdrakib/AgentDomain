# AutoGen + AgentDomain

These files are thin imports and CLI launchers for the native Python package
`agentdomain-autogen` (import `agentdomain_autogen`). The guarded workbench,
argument validation, environment policy, AssistantAgent and command-line logic
are maintained only in that package. AgentDomain still uses its separate Node.js
MCP bridge over stdio; Python AutoGen has not become an npm framework.

## Install

Release targets: `agentdomain-autogen==0.11.0` on PyPI and
`@agentdomain/mcp-server@0.11.0` on npm. Do not assume either new release has
been published merely because these source files exist.

After verified publication, install the Python requirements in an isolated venv
and the exact Node MCP bridge in a trusted directory:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt
npm install --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund @agentdomain/mcp-server@0.11.0
```

For release staging from the public checkout, install the reviewed local wheel
before running these examples or native tests:

```bash
python -m build --outdir .qa/autogen-package/dist packages/autogen-plugin
python -m pip install \
  -r packages/mcp-server/examples/autogen/framework-requirements.txt \
  -c packages/mcp-server/examples/autogen/constraints.txt
python -m pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps --no-index \
  .qa/autogen-package/dist/agentdomain_autogen-0.11.0-py3-none-any.whl
python -m pip check
```

Keep all venvs and caches under the ignored `.qa/` directory when developing in
the public repository. There is no editable/source import fallback: tests must
exercise the installed distribution.
CI uses `framework-requirements.txt`, not the self-package consumer requirement,
so the first release never needs to fetch itself from PyPI before it exists.

## Use

Prefer the package directly:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from agentdomain_autogen import AgentDomainWorkbench, inspect_and_prepare, server_parameters

params = server_parameters(
    Path("/absolute/path/to/node"),
    installed_package=Path("/trusted/node_modules/@agentdomain/mcp-server"),
)

async def inspect():
    async with AgentDomainWorkbench(params) as tools:
        return await inspect_and_prepare(tools, {"domain": "your-domain.xyz"})
```

The installed `agentdomain-autogen` command or `python -m agentdomain_autogen`
runs deterministic inspection without an LLM. The compatibility command
`python inspect_renewal.py` accepts the same options:

```bash
agentdomain-autogen --node /absolute/path/to/node \
  --installed-package /trusted/node_modules/@agentdomain/mcp-server \
  --domain your-domain.xyz
```

An explicit development alternative is `--source-checkout /reviewed/built/AgentDomain`.
Build the public shared/SDK/MCP packages through the repository's reviewed
workflow first. Never accept either trusted path or launch configuration from
an LLM, tool output or untrusted website.

The workflow exposes `inspect_agent_identity`, `inspect_agent_renewal` and
`prepare_auto_renew_change`. For a proposal, supply `--token-id`,
`--expected-owner`, `--builder-code` and either `--prepare-enable` or
`--prepare-disable`. The output is an unsigned setting plan for separate human
review. It does not sign, fund, approve, execute or complete a registrar renewal.
A minimum fee is not a registrar quote; a model's approval is not wallet authority.

For a real optional AssistantAgent, import `create_assistant(model, workbench)`.
The `assistant_example.py` compatibility launcher delegates to the package's
optional CLI, which accepts trusted owner model configuration through
`AUTOGEN_MODEL_CONFIG`. Configure your own provider extra separately. Model
calls may cost money; provider keys/config are never persisted or sent to Node.
The deterministic examples and fixture tests need no model key.

See the [canonical package guide](https://github.com/0xmdrakib/AgentDomain/tree/main/packages/autogen-plugin)
for exact bounds, pinned framework versions, owner-approval and environment
boundaries, packaging and usage. The legacy `agentdomain_workbench.py` module
only re-exports those package APIs; it has no separate guard implementation.

## Native Checks

Use the interpreter where the reviewed wheel is installed:

```bash
AGENTDOMAIN_AUTOGEN_PYTHON=/absolute/path/to/venv/bin/python \
  node --test packages/mcp-server/test/autogen.integration.test.mjs
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:AGENTDOMAIN_AUTOGEN_PYTHON = 'C:/absolute/path/to/venv/Scripts/python.exe'
node --test packages/mcp-server/test/autogen.integration.test.mjs
```

The suite verifies the installed package origin, actual AutoGen/AssistantAgent
and MCP/SDK execution through labelled synthetic RPC fixtures, strict inputs,
minimal child environment and shutdown of all fixture-owned MCP processes.
Without the selected Python interpreter the optional test is explicitly skipped.
These are not paid LLM calls, live wallet transactions or customer observations.
